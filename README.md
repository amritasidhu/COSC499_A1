This program includes code that automatically sorts arrays in java. As of now, the  array has been inserted manually into the program. Java takes this data, and uses its built in sort function from its Arrays library to sort the array. If the sort is done accurately, then output will be the test has passed.

Initially, our main branch will sort 5 positive integers. 

Further, two features are implemented in 2 branches. 

The first branch (b1) will be able to sort 10 positive integers of a wide range from least to greatest. 

The second branch (b2) will be able to sort negative integers from least to greatest.
